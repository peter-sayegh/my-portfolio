            <h3>Dynamic Stability and Levitation Control in Maglev Systems</h3>
            <p>As part of a research-oriented team study on Maglev trains, we developped theoretical models, a tailored experimental setup, and numerical simulations, to demonstrate effective levitation control strategies that enhance system stability. This is a working draft currently in preparation for submission to the <em>American Journal of Physics</em>. It has not been peer-reviewed.</p>

            <h3>Ultrafast Nonlinear Acoustics in Free-standing Membranes at the Nanoscale</h3>
            <p>This paper explores the properties of nonlinear acoustic strain wave propagation in solid crystals,
                integrating both experimental data analysis and numerical modeling. By introducing the Korteweg-
                De Vries (KdV) equation, we describe soliton propagation within certain nonlinear systems. The
                study simulates several physical scenarios, including the compression of a sequence of acoustic pulses,
                reflection at a free interface, and acoustic attenuation. These simulations provide insights into the
                complex behavior of nonlinear acoustic waves, which could have significant implications for the design
                and analysis of advanced materials and acoustic devices. This project was conducted at <em> Laboratoire des Solides Irradiés</em>
                 (LSI) under the supervision of Dr. Vasily Temnov.

            <h3>Rogue Waves Dynamics using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)</h3>
            <p> Rogue waves are rare, unpredictable surface waves that exceed twice the height of surrounding waves and can appear suddenly from unexpected directions. 
                Unlike tsunamis, these localized phenomena—sometimes surpassing 30 meters—arise from nonlinear energy focusing and pose significant risks to even the largest ships.This study focuses on training PINNs to solve the self-focusing Non-Linear Schrödinger equation and model the balance between
                nonlinearity and viscosity. This internship took place at LadHyX under the supervision of Prof. Christophe Josserand in January-March 2025.

            <h3>Predicting Travel Insurance Purchases Using Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
                This project implemented several machine learning concepts to predict travel insurance purchases, focusing on key features like Annual Income and Travel History. Models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Neural Networks, and Decision Trees were trained on a dataset of 2,000 samples. 
                Despite class imbalance, Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting provided the best results with an accuracy of 83.4%. The model helps insurance companies target potential buyers efficiently, improving marketing and resource allocation.

            <h3> Concept Note-taking Application</h3>
            <p>
            We developped a WebApp using Object-Oriented Programming in C++ and UI design in QML. Concept is a note-taking application that allow you to take notes in Markdown format and organize them in a file list structure. The application is written in C++ and use the Qt framework for the GUI. This project is a CMake project and it is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS.
